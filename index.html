          <p class="disDis">
            Carbon is an element which is present everywhere. In most places people write Carbon as ‘C’.  It is present in trees, fruits, coal, diamond, and even yourself. It is present in almost everything that can be burnt and that is why it is the element that causes harm to earth and the people. Carbon when burnt gives out Carbon dioxide which increases the average temperature of earth. The temperature is increasing annually and soon the temperature will become so high that no person will be able to live without an air-conditioner. 
Further we will tell you what is Carbon Footprint, how to calculate it, and how to reduce it.

          <p class="dis1">How to calculate your impact on ‘Earth’?</p>

          <p class="disDis">
            Some Environmentalists and Ecologists have come up with the term of ‘Carbon Footprint’ which means how much carbon a person has contributed to harm the earth but that does not mean that you cannot reduce it. Carbon Footprint takes into account all the carbon dioxide that has been released for you. For example- if you eat dairy products then you should take into account the food that the animals are given, the land required, and the water given to them. 
The best example of a Carbon Footprint will be one which involves many factors like the food you eat, fuel you burn for travelling or cooking, wastes you throw, electricity you use, etc.
To be more specific some sub-categories that mainly contribute to Carbon Footprint of a person are:

          </p>
          <p class="disDis">
            •	Home energy use <br>• waste production <br>•	Travel <br> •	Diet <br> •	Shopping
          </p>

          <p class="disDis">
            There is a Calculator that we have devised to help you in calculating an approximate value of your Carbon Footprint. You can go to the Calculator bar from the Menu Bar and fill in the form (with someone’s help if you are below the age of 13).

          <p class="dis1">How to reduce your Carbon Footprint and make the Earth a better place to live in?</p>

          <p class="disDis">
            All this talk of carbon emissions and footprints might leave you with one question – why should you reduce them? After all, how much of an impact can one individual have, particularly compared to governments and big businesses? But that is where you are wrong.
It’s not just about the environment. Reducing your carbon footprint can help you live a healthier lifestyle, as well as save you money. Whether it’s cleaner air, a healthier diet, or reduced energy bills, these benefits of reducing your carbon footprint also mean you’re doing your bit to combat climate change. 
If we can add to something we can also subtract from it and therefore there are many things that can be done to reduce Carbon Footprint. Many people think that things like saving the world and contributing to a cause is very difficult whereas it is exactly the opposite, it is not that the things you need to do are difficult, but that not many people understand this and do not do anything for making the earth less polluted. 
Some of the things that you can do to reduce your Carbon Footprint are:

          </p>

          <br>

          
            <p class="disDis"><b>•	Buy energy efficient appliances: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Electrical appliances are becoming more efficient by the year. Whether it’s buying energy-saving light bulbs or choosing appliances with a high energy star rating, you can make your home more eco-friendly.
             </p>
             <br>

            <p class="disDis"><b>•	Save water: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              It takes energy and resources to process and deliver water to our homes. So, by using less, you can help the environment and lower your carbon footprint. Turn off the taps when brushing your teeth, have short showers rather than baths, and only boil the water you need. 
             </p>
             <br>

            <p class="disDis"><b>•	Change your diet: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              The food we eat can have a significant impact on the environment. By eating fewer animal products, especially red meat, and shopping for locally sourced food, you can make a big difference. 
             </p>
             <br>

            <p class="disDis"><b>•	Save electricity: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Switch off lights, fans, and appliances whenever not required. It takes a lot of energy to generate electricity and it is one of the major factors to calculate Carbon Footprint.
             </p>
             <br>

            <p class="disDis"><b>•	Cycle:  </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Choose cycling over fuel powered vehicles for possible distances as it will lessen the fuel used by you.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p class="disDis"><b>•	Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:  </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Whether it’s things like paper, electronic devices, packaging, or water, it all has a carbon footprint. By reducing the amount of waste you generate, reusing IT equipment, and recycling waste, you can make a real difference. 
             </p>
             <br>

             <p class="disDis"><b>•	Reduce use of plastic bags:  </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Plastics are one of the major things that effect our climate and thus must not be used.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p class="disDis"><b>•	Use public transport: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Public transport is much more fuel efficient and reduces you carbon footprint by a huge amount. Whenever possible you should use a public transport to travel.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p class="disDis"><b>•	Raise awareness: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Raising awareness is an important part of reducing carbon offsets. Many people do not know about Carbon footprint, climate change, etc. By spreading awareness more people can donate to the cause and help improve climatic conditions.
             </p>
             <br>


             <p class="disDis"><b>•	Digitalize: </b></p>
             <p class="disDis">
              Nowadays most things can be done through are mobile phones or other devices. This can help in saving paper and thus reduce Carbon footprint. So, you must make digital documents and not waste paper.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p class="disDis">
              You can always take an environmentally friendly approach. Try and walk, cycle, or use public transport, save electricity and water, eat proper food, and leave as light a carbon footprint as possible.
              Now you have almost all the knowledge that you need to contribute to saving the world. Spread awareness and become environment friendly.
              
             </p>

            Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by making power on-site with renewables and other climate-friendly energy resources. Examples include rooftop solar panels, solar water heating, small-scale wind generation, fuel cells powered by natural gas or renewable hydrogen, and geothermal energy.
